# Colorblind Friendly Tester

## Using the Website
This GitHub contains the source code for this website: [https://bioapps.byu.edu/colorblind_friendly_tester]
We intend for the website to function as a tool for researchers preparing manuscripts to verify that their images
are colorblind-friendly to people with deuteranopia (red-green colorblind).

A user can upload a JPG or PNG image to the website and an image is returned how someone with 80% deuteranopia would see 
that same image. If the user wants, they can then run that deuteranopia-simulated image through our machine learning model
and return a confidence score for whether the image is colorblind-friendly or not.
